/**
 * final-gate — the run-level integration gate /task-auto runs ONCE, after every
 * task is checked off and before the run is declared complete.
 *
 * The failure this closes (mx5 runs 3 and 5, validated): every existing gate is
 * per-task/per-slice, so a run can finish with each slice individually blessed
 * while the ASSEMBLED project is dead — statics green yet every protected route
 * 500ing, 105/174 tests failing across slices, later tasks breaking files earlier
 * tasks verified. Per-task repo-health closes the static half; nothing ever ran
 * the project's own test/build commands against the finished whole.
 *
 * Like repo-health-check (whose discovery style this mirrors), it is deterministic
 * — no model, no per-file narrowing, no "not my task" gray area. It discovers the
 * project's OWN integration commands (the ones a fresh checkout / CI would run)
 * and lets their REAL exit codes decide:
 *
 *   - static analysis first (runRepoHealthCheck — cheap, precise), then
 *   - lockfile↔manifest consistency (mx5 run 7, validated: the lockfile carried a
 *     dependency no committed manifest declared, so the tree tested green here
 *     but a FRESH CHECKOUT could not even install — each ecosystem's own offline
 *     "is the lock in sync" command decides), then
 *   - the project's own `test` and `build` commands, run verbatim and unaided.
 *
 * Environment-gap safety, same contract as repo-health-check: a command that
 * CANNOT run (ENOENT, exit 127 = command-not-found inside the script chain, or a
 * timeout) is an environment problem, not a code fault — it is SKIPPED, never
 * failed. Only a command that actually ran and exited non-zero fails the gate,
 * and the reason carries the tail of its real output so the user (and a resume
 * fix) can act on it. A test suite that needs a database will fail here when the
 * database is genuinely reachable-but-mis-wired — which is exactly the class the
 * per-task gates kept excusing — and the caller puts a human on the decision
 * (accept / leave failed), so a genuine external gap can still be overridden.
